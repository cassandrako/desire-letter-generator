**My Desire Letter Generator is based around the desire to travel abroad.**

To use my code, in your terminal run:

python3 love_letter.py

You will be prompted to either pick your own words or to choose RANDOM. Afterwards, you can shift your letter through Caesar cipher.



**Here's an example of what it should look like:**

--------------------------------------------------

Please enter a greeting (Type 'RANDOM' for a random choice): RANDOM
Please enter a location (Type 'RANDOM' for a random choice): RANDOM
Please enter a desire (Type 'RANDOM' for a random choice): RANDOM
Please enter a secret (Type 'RANDOM' for a random choice): RANDOM
Please enter a farewell (Type 'RANDOM' for a random choice): RANDOM

Generated Letter:

A warm hello from Thailand!

My life here is so eventful, freeing, every day feels like a dream. I dream of spending my life here.
Between exploring new places and trying out local cuisine in both the street markets and restaurants, I've found so much joy here.
But the thought of returning to daily routines is tiring. 
I've made so many memories, and I can't wait to share them with you. When will I see you again... if I choose to never return ever again.
Yours truly,
Cassandra

Enter a number to shift each letter (e.g., 3 for Caesar cipher): 7
